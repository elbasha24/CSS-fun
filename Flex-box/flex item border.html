<!-- This code is an example of HTML and CSS demonstrating the use of different border styles for flex items.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used for creating the structure of web pages, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling these web pages.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

HTML: The code starts with declaring the document type as HTML5 using <!DOCTYPE html>. The lang attribute in the html tag is set to "en" for English language. There are several nested elements within the body tag.
<h2>: The "Flex Item Borders Example" heading is created with the h2 tag.
<div class="flex-item">: These are the flex items, each with a class named "flex-item". The text within each div is used to demonstrate different border styles.
CSS: The CSS code is included within the style tags in the head section. It consists of two main elements:
body: The body element has the following styles applied:

margin: 20px;: A margin of 20 pixels is applied to the body.
font-family: Arial, sans-serif;: The font family is set to Arial or any sans-serif font.
display: flex;: The body is set to a flex container.
justify-content: center;: The flex items are horizontally centered.
align-items: center;: The flex items are vertically centered.
min-height: 100vh;: The minimum height of the body is set to 100 viewport height.
background-color: #f5f5f5;: The background color is set to light gray.
.flex-item: The flex items have the following styles applied:

margin: 0 10px;: A margin of 0 pixels on the top and bottom, and 10 pixels on the left and right is applied to the flex items.
text-align: center;: The text is centered within the flex items.
padding: 20px;: Padding of 20 pixels is applied to the flex items.
box-sizing: border-box;: The box sizing is set to border-box, which means that the padding and border are included in the total width and height.
border: 2px solid #ccc;: A border of 2 pixels with a solid gray color is applied to the flex items.
border-radius: 5px;: The border radius is set to 5 pixels, creating rounded corners.
background-color: white;: The background color of the flex items is set to white. -->
