1. `display: grid / inline-grid`: This property sets an element as a grid container or inline grid container.

 The `display: grid` and `display: inline-grid` properties are used to establish a grid container, but they differ in the way they affect the behavior of the content within the container.

1. `display: grid`: When you apply `display: grid` to an element, it becomes a block-level grid container. The element starts a new block formatting context, meaning that its children do not inherit margins from their parents and are laid out independently of surrounding elements. Additionally, the grid container establishes a new grid formatting context, creating a flexible layout that allows you to control the positioning and sizing of its children using various grid properties.

Block-level grid containers expand to occupy the entire width and height of their containing block, unless specified otherwise using properties like `width`, `height`, `padding`, `border`, or `margin`. They also support multi-column and multi-row layouts, allowing you to divide the container into a predefined number of rows and columns.
2. `display: inline-grid`: Unlike `display: grid`, applying `display: inline-grid` makes the element an inline-level grid container. This means that the container participates in the inline formatting context, and its children inherit margins from their parents. As a result, inline-grid containers don't create a new block formatting context.

Inline-level grid containers are suitable for laying out content along a single line of text, similar to how block-level grid containers work horizontally rather than vertically. However, keep in mind that support for inline-grid is limited in certain browsers, so you might need to consider fallbacks or alternative approaches for cross-browser compatibility.

To summarize, the key differences between `display: grid` and `display: inline-grid` are:

* `display: grid` creates a block-level grid container, while `display: inline-grid` creates an inline-level grid container.
* Block-level grid containers create a new block formatting context, whereas inline-level grid containers participate in the inline formatting context.
* Block-level grid containers are typically used for multi-column and multi-row layouts, while inline-level grid containers are best suited for single-line layouts.

Keep in mind that support for `display: inline-grid` is relatively limited compared to `display: grid`. Therefore, you might encounter issues with rendering or functionality in some browsers.



2. `grid-template-rows / grid-template-columns`: These properties define the number and sizing of rows and columns, respectively. They accept length units like pixels, percentages, fractions, etc., and keywords such as `auto`, `minmax()`, and `repeat()`.

 Yes, my apologies for the confusion earlier. Let me clarify the differences between `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns`:

Both `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns` are CSS Grid properties that define the structure of the grid container by setting up the rows and columns, respectively. Each property accepts different types of values:

1. `grid-template-rows`: This property takes multiple comma-separated values defining the size of each row. The accepted values include:
	* Length units: pixels, ems, rems, %, fr units, etc.
	* Keywords: auto, minmax(), repeat(), and maxcontent
	* Percentage values represent the proportion of the grid container's height allocated to each row.
	* fr units indicate fractional parts of the remaining space after allocating proportions to other rows or columns.
	* minmax() function allows you to set a range of minimum and maximum dimensions for a row.
	* repeat() function enables you to duplicate a pattern of rows a specified number of times.
2. `grid-template-columns`: Similar to `grid-template-rows`, this property uses comma-separated values to define the size of each column. The accepted values are the same as those for `grid-template-rows`, except for the fact that percentage values represent the proportion of the grid container's width allocated to each column.

The main difference between the two lies in their purpose and the axis they operate on:

* `grid-template-rows` specifically deals with the rows of the grid container, determining the height of each row.
* `grid-template-columns` exclusively focuses on the columns, establishing the width of each column.

By adjusting these properties, you can control the overall structure of the grid and allocate space accordingly for rows and columns. Combining them with other grid properties, such as `grid-gap`, `grid-row-gap`, and `grid-column-gap`, allows you to fine-tune the appearance and layout of your grid system.




3. `grid-row-gap / grid-column-gap`: These properties control the spacing between rows and columns, respectively.

Now let me briefly describe the differences between `grid-row-gap` and `grid-column-gap`:

These two properties control the spacing between the rows and columns of a grid container, respectively. Both properties accept length units like pixels, ems, rems, percentages, or other valid CSS length values.

1. `grid-row-gap`: This property sets the vertical gap between adjacent grid rows. Increasing the value of `grid-row-gap` will create additional space above and below each row, effectively increasing the distance between rows.
2. `grid-column-gap`: Conversely, this property sets the horizontal gap between adjacent grid columns. Adjusting the value of `grid-column-gap` will add extra space between columns, widening the separation between neighboring cells.

While both properties serve a similar purpose—adding space around grid elements—they target different axes of the grid layout:

* `grid-row-gap` affects the vertical spacing between rows, operating along the block axis.
* `grid-column-gap` impacts the horizontal spacing between columns, acting along the inline axis.

Using these properties, you can easily customize the appearance of your grid layout and improve readability by providing appropriate spacing between rows and columns. Keep in mind that excessive spacing could lead to wasted space and reduced efficiency, so always balance spacing with content density and usability.




4. `grid-row-start / grid-column-start / grid-row-end / grid-column-end`: These properties determine the starting and ending lines/lines for rows and columns, respectively.

 The properties `grid-row-start`, `grid-column-start`, `grid-row-end`, and `grid-column-end` help you define the positions of individual grid items within a grid container. Together, these properties enable you to precisely control where an element begins and ends along the grid rows and columns.

1. `grid-row-start`: This property sets the starting line of a grid item along the vertical axis. Line numbers start from 1, with the first line being line 1. Assigning higher line numbers moves the element downwards. Values can be positive integers, negative integers, fractions, or auto. Using auto lets the browser decide the row based on the previous grid item's row.
2. `grid-column-start`: Similar to `grid-row-start`, this property sets the starting column of a grid item along the horizontal axis. Column numbers also begin at 1, and you can use positive, negative, fractional, or auto values. An auto value places the element based on the previous grid item's column.
3. `grid-row-end`: This property determines the ending line of a grid item along the vertical axis. Positive integer values represent the last line before the next row starts, while negative integer values count backwards from the current line. Fractional values and auto are also acceptable. Setting a high enough line number will make the element span multiple rows.
4. `grid-column-end`: analogous to `grid-row-end`, this property sets the ending column of a grid item along the horizontal axis. Like `grid-row-end`, it accepts positive, negative, fractional, or auto values. Providing a large enough column number causes the element to span multiple columns.

These four properties allow you to control the exact placement of grid items within a container by specifying their starting and ending points along both the row and column axes. To illustrate, consider the following example:
```css
.item1 {
  grid-row-start: 1;
  grid-row-end: 2;
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: 3;
}
```
In this case, the element with the class `.item1` will start at the first row and first column, and extend until the second row and third column, covering three columns.

Combined with other grid properties like `grid-gap`, `grid-template-rows`, and `grid-template-columns`, you can achieve highly intricate and dynamic layouts for your web designs. Remember that browser support for these properties is generally good, with most modern browsers offering full or near-full support.



5. `justify-items / align-items`: These properties control item alignment along the start and end lines of the grid track, respectively.

 `justify-items` and `align-items` are CSS Grid Properties responsible for controlling the alignment and distribution of individual grid items along the grid lines. While `justify-items` manages the horizontal alignment, `align-items` handles the vertical alignment.

1. `justify-items`: This property aligns the content of grid items along the horizontal grid lines, known as the inline axis. Its values include:
	* start: Aligns the content to the beginning of the grid line.
	* end: Places the content at the end of the grid line.
	* center: Centers the content along the grid line.
	* stretch: Expands the content to fill the entire grid cell, making it equal in size to the grid container.
2. `align-items`: On the other hand, this property controls the vertical alignment of the content within grid cells, referred to as the block axis. Its values mirror those of `justify-items`:
	* start: Aligns the content to the top of the grid line.
	* end: Positions the content at the bottom of the grid line.
	* center: Centralizes the content along the grid line.
	* stretch: Stretches the content to cover the entire height of the grid cell, matching the size of the grid container.

When combined, these properties allow you to create well-structured and visually appealing grid layouts. For instance, you can align text within cards centered on the grid and distribute images uniformly across the rows and columns.

Consider the following example:
```css
.card {
  justify-items: center;
  align-items: center;
  grid-row-gap: 10px;
}
```
In this case, the elements with the class `.card` will have their content centered both horizontally and vertically within each grid cell.

It's important to note that `justify-items` and `align-items` are shorthand properties that combine the effects of `justify-content` and `align-content` with the explicit definition of the grid area using `grid-area`. If you use `grid-area` to define the grid cells for your items, `justify-items` and `align-items` become redundant, and you must rely solely on `justify-content` and `align-content` to achieve the desired effect.



 I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. I misunderstood your question regarding elaboration on specific properties. I will now address the requested properties individually.

**6. `place-content`, `place-items`, and `place-self`:**

These properties are part of the CSS Container Query Module, which has been proposed but not yet standardized. They aim to simplify the process of placing items within a grid container by reducing the need for manual calculations and multiple declarations.

* `place-content`: This property is used to position the content of all children elements within a grid container based on the specified criteria. It combines the effects of `justify-items`, `align-items`, `justify-content`, and `align-content`.
* `place-items`: Similar to `place-content`, this property centers and distributes the content of all direct children within the grid container. However, unlike `place-content`, `place-items` does not take inherited values from ancestor elements.
* `place-self`: This property applies the same centering and distributing principles to the element itself, instead of its children. It combines the effects of `justify-self`, `align-self`, `justify-content`, and `align-content`.

Since the CSS Container Query Module is currently under development and not yet widely supported, these properties are not commonly used in practice. Nonetheless, they offer promising potential for streamlining complex grid layout creation once fully implemented.

**7. `grid-template-areas`**:

As mentioned previously, `grid-template-areas` is used to define named grid areas within a grid container. By naming regions within the grid, developers can more intuitively position child elements. This approach is particularly helpful when working with complex layouts or when collaboration involves non-technical team members.

You define named areas using a string of characters enclosed in curly braces, followed by a mapping of names to grid lines. For example:
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header header"
    "nav content content"
    "footer footer footer";
}
```
In this case, three named areas ("header", "nav", "content", "footer") are defined, and corresponding child elements can be placed in the designated areas using the `grid-area` property.

**8. `grid-area`**:

As explained earlier, the `grid-area` property specifies the grid area for an element by combining the row and column indices. It consists of four components: the row group, column group, row line, and column line. For example:
```css
.element {
  grid-area: 2 / 1 / 3 / 4;
}
```
This rule places the element in the grid area starting at row 2 and column 1, and extending to row 3 and column 4.

**9. `grid-row` and `grid-column`**:

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response. These properties were incorrectly included in the list provided. They are actually not relevant to CSS Grid Layout. Instead, you should focus on `grid-row-start`, `grid-row-end`, `grid-column-start`, and `grid-column-end` properties for defining the position of grid items along the rows and columns.

**10. `z-index`**:

Lastly, `z-index` is indeed not exclusive to CSS Grid Layout, but it plays a crucial role in managing the stacking order of elements. It dictates which element appears in front of others when multiple elements overlap. Elements with a higher z-index value will be rendered above elements with lower values. The property works well with CSS Grid, helping you create layered compositions or interactions within a grid container.
