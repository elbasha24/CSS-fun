<!-- grid template area

The grid-template-areas property in CSS Grid Layout allows you to define named grid areas within your grid container. This provides a more semantic and readable way to position grid items compared to using explicit grid lines with grid-column and grid-row.

Here's how it works:

    Define Named Areas:
        You use grid-template-areas on the grid container to specify a string representation of your desired grid layout.
        Within the string, each cell in the grid is represented by a name, enclosed in quotes (e.g., "header", "main", "sidebar").
        You arrange these names in a comma-separated list, mimicking the row structure of your grid.
        Multiple lines within the string represent rows in the grid.

    Assign Areas to Items:
        Each grid item element can have a grid-area property set to the name of the area it should occupy within the grid.
        By referencing the same name, you link the item to the corresponding area defined in grid-template-areas.

Example:
HTML -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Grid Template Areas Example</title>
<style>
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); /* Two equal-width columns */
  grid-gap: 10px;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "main sidebar";
}

.grid-item {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  padding: 10px;
  text-align: center;
}

.header {
  grid-area: header;
  background-color: #eee;
}

.main {
  grid-area: main;
}

.sidebar {
  grid-area: sidebar;
  background-color: #ddd;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item header">Header</div>
  <div class="grid-item main">Main Content</div>
  <div class="grid-item sidebar">Sidebar</div>
</body>
</html>

<!-- Use code with caution.

Explanation:

    The code defines two columns and uses grid-template-areas:
        "header header": Creates two "header" areas in the first row.
        "main sidebar": Creates a "main" area and a "sidebar" area in the second row.
    Each grid item class references the corresponding area name using grid-area.

Benefits of using grid-template-areas:

    Improved Readability: Makes the layout structure more understandable, especially for complex grids.
    Maintainability: Easier to modify the layout by changing area names in one place (grid-template-areas).
    Flexibility: Areas can span multiple grid cells by repeating the name in the string definition.

Additional Considerations:

    The number of cells in each row of the grid-template-areas string should match the number of columns defined in grid-template-columns.
    Empty cells can be represented by a single dot (".") in the string.
    grid-template-areas works in conjunction with grid line properties (grid-column, grid-row) for more fine-grained control if needed.

By effectively using grid-template-areas, you can create clear, maintainable, and well-structured CSS grid layouts with named regions for your content. -->
